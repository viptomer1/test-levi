# Architecture:

I have decided to use a popular libraray Reactjs to create this project. If we create this project in plain js then we have to make multiple controls for screen flow and data flow which we can use from these Js frameworks without writing them.

I can make this app in serveral way like using Angular or Jquery or even usingother Js frameworking but decided to use react as this is something I am learning now and it will give me handson experience as well as exponse my learnings along with this assignment:)



Created react app(test-levi) first simply as we need to create product screen flow hence using react so that we can flow data between screens.
<br>Even react app will provide native features for different plateforms as well.

<br><br> push the branch as master first and will use <b>'release'</b> branch further for adding feature.
